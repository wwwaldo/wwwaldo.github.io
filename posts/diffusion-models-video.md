Diffusion models have demonstrated strong results on image synthesis in past years. Now the research
community is extending them to video generation, which introduces new challenges in maintaining temporal
consistency and managing computational resources across frames.

## Key Challenges in Video Diffusion

Video generation poses unique challenges compared to image generation:

- Temporal consistency between frames
- Computational complexity scaling with video length
- Memory constraints when processing multiple frames
- Motion modeling and physics consistency

## Recent Advances

Several approaches have emerged to tackle these challenges:

1. **Frame Interpolation**: Generating intermediate frames to ensure smooth transitions
2. **Motion Transfer**: Applying learned motion patterns to static images
3. **Hierarchical Generation**: Creating videos at multiple temporal resolutions

## Future Directions

The field of video diffusion models is rapidly evolving, with several promising directions:

- More efficient architectures for longer sequences
- Better motion consistency mechanisms
- Integration with other modalities (audio, text)
- Real-time generation capabilities
